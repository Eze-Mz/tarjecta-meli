# Just a card for a graduation

Created with Astro. I also used these things from the internet

- card -> the card from the miduconf: https://github.com/midudev/miduconf-website
- gift box -> https://codepen.io/ElaineXu/pen/EWvGWX
- piano -> https://codepen.io/lerida/pen/bGwzVvo

You solve a simple puzzle (if you want), then put your name, select a sticker and you get the card!

(The code can be a bit messy because a put it all together as fast as I could).
